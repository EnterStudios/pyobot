    <h1>Pyobot</h1>
    <p class="lead">Pyobot is a Discord and Facebook Messenger bot for popular Pokemon GO game that uses an existing map system (<a href="https://londonpogomap.com/">LondonPogoMap</a>      in the first implementation) to deliver alerts about rare spawns that you can catch.</p>
    <p>The original implementation was done by Pyorot, then it was converted from a browser script into Node.js application.
      The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/moriakaice/pyobot">Github</a>.</p>

    <h2>How to use?</h2>
    <p>Please refer to our <a href="/help">Help</a> and <a href="/help-advanced">Advanced Users Help</a> pages for information on how to use the bot.</p>

    <h2>Stats are fun</h2>

    <h2>Privacy concerns</h2>
    <p>As with every server tool, you have to keep in mind that any data you share with the bot (especially location) is going
      to be stored in the database. Even though we will keep only the last location you give us (and any new location will
      overwrite the old value) and you can always remove it by using <code>!unsetLocation</code> command, this might be a
      privacy concern for some.</p>
    <p>On Discord, you'll be identified by the channel ID of the DM between you and the bot. Since we <strong>do not</strong>      store your user ID or nickname, there should be no easy way to identify who is the data belonging to even to the bot
      maintainers.
    </p>
    <p>On Facebook Messenger, however, even though you are identified by the Facebook Application User Id, which is different
      to your Facebook User Id, the page will maintain your chat history, so it will be easy to identify the account used
      to communicate with the bot that way for the Facebook Page maintainers.</p>
    <p>If privacy is a concern to you, we can suggest some solutions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use location that's not straight on your home/work place, but somewhere close enough and just adjust the range of your
        tracking
      </li>
      <li>Use spare/fake account to do communication with the bot, so that it is not easy to associate your real identity with
        the location provided</li>
      <li>Unset your location when you don't need the notifications to minimise the time it is available in the database</li>
      <li>Do not use ranged notifications, but rather stick to "all" range, so that you won't have to share your location at
        all
      </li>
    </ul>
