    <h1><a href="/">Pyobot</a> - help</h1>
    <p class="lead">Pyobot, as a bot supporting various means of communication, is somewhat intimidating at first to use. This Help page
      is here to help you learn about the basics and see how to operate the notification service.</p>
    <p>If, after reading all of this, you still feel you have problems using the bot, feel free to chat to us on <a href="https://discord.gg/AWdp2BM">Discord</a>      and we will be happy to assist you in your quest to catch'em all!</p>

    <a name="platforms"></a>
    <h2>Supported platforms</h2>
    <p>Currently, the bot operates via two platforms: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LondonPokeGoTrackerNotifications/">Facebook Messenger</a>      and <a href="https://discord.gg/AWdp2BM">Discord</a> (both on public channels and via the Direct Messages (DM)).</p>
    <p>This help file will apply to both platforms at the same time, unless otherwise stated.</p>

    <a name="how-to-start"></a>
    <h2>How to start?</h2>
    <p>After picking the platform you're more comfortable with, the easiest way to start is just sending a simple command to
      the bot: <code>!register</code>. As you'll notice reading this document, all of the commands will start with exclamation
      mark. This is done to ease discrimination between bot commands and normal talk.</p>

    <a name="tracking"></a>
    <h2>Tracking and untracking Pokemon</h2>
    <p>This might be the most important function of the bot - allowing you to select which of the rare Pokemon you want to track.</p>
    <p>With the current settings, we allow you to track the following Pokemon:</p>
    <div class="trackingPokemon"></div>
    <p>To set up your tracking, simply use the following command: <code>!track &lt;Pokemon&gt; &lt;distance&gt;</code>. For
      Pokemon, you can either use its name or ID (so using <em>Dratini</em> and <em>147</em> will give you the same result).</p>
    <p>Distance can be provided in the following forms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>all</em> - will track all the sightings, regardless of where they spawn;</li>
      <li><em>500</em> - will track the sightings in a given radius around your set location (in metres) - 500 metres in this
        example;
      </li>
      <li><em>0.5km</em> - same as above, but specified in kilometres;</em>
        <li><em>0.310686mi</em> - same as above, but specified in miles;</em>
    </ul>
    <p>Word of warning here: if you set up the range-based notifications, but do not set up your location (or unset it) - the
      bot will NOT notify you about those, since it will be unable to calculate the distance between the spawn and your location.</p>
    <p>To stop tracking selected Pokemon, just issue: <code>!untrack &lt;Pokemon&gt;</code>. You can also replace Pokemon with
      <em>all</em> to remove all your set up trackings.</p>

    <h3>Tracking command examples with explanations</h3>
    <p><code>!track Unown all</code> - this command will make you receive a notification about Unown (ID: 201) spawning anywhere
      in London.</p>
    <p><code>!track Dratini 500</code> - this command, given you set your location, will notify you about Dratinis spawning
      within the 500 metres radius of your location.</p>
    <p><code>!track 3 1km</code> - this command, given you set your location, will notify you about Venusaurs (ID: 3) spawning
      within the 1 km radius of your location.</p>
    <p><code>!track Larvitar 1.5mi</code> - this command, given you set your location, will notify you about Larvitars spawning
      within the 1.5 miles radius of your location.</p>

    <h3>Tracking multiple Pokemon</h3>
    <p>If you want to track more than one Pokemon, just issue individual commands for each Pokemon you want to be tracked.</p>
    <p>At the moment, there is no way to do this all in one command, however it is something we are looking into.</p>

    <a name="location"></a>
    <h2>Setting and unsetting your location</h2>
    <p>In order to take advantage of tracking only spawns close to you on the distance basis, you have to set up your location
      point so that the bot will be able to check if the new spawn is within your range of interest (for nerds: we use Haversine
      forumla to check).</p>
    <p>To set your location, use the following command: <code>!setLocation lat, lng</code>. You can find out the coordinates
      from Google Maps or services like <a href="https://www.where-am-i.net/">Where Am I</a>. Please make sure the coordinates
      you are using are provided in the decimal format, as the bot won't convert other types of coordinates for you. Example:
      <code>!setLocation 51.501461, -0.141611</code> - this will set your location to just in front of Buckingham Palace
      (say <em>Hello</em> to the Queen from us!).</p>
    <p>Facebook Messenger users can just share their location directly with the bot via the mobile application - just open the
      conversation with the bot, click on the Plus symbol located in the bottom left corner and select Location from the
      menu. Pick the location you want to use as a centre for any distance calculations and notifications and send it to
      bot. It can't get any simpler, can it?</p>
    <p>We will only keep your latest location, which means setting a new one overwrites the previous. However, if you want it
      completely removed from our database, use: <code>!unsetLocation</code>.</p>

    <a name="favorite-location"></a>
    <h2>Setting favorite locations</h2>
    <p>To save time when setting locations, you might want to create a list of your favorite locations to select from.</p>
    <p>In order to do so, use command: <code>!saveLocation lat, lng name</code>. Name can be any combination of letters, numbers
      and dashes.</p>
    <p>To use this location, simply replace coordinates in <code>!setLocation</code> command to your set name.</p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <p><code>!saveLocation 51.501461, -0.141611 BuckinghamPalace</code> will save that as a favorite location. After that, you
      can do <code>!setLocation BuckinghamPalace</code> at any time to move your tracking centre to that location.</p>

    <a name="my-tracking"></a>
    <h2>Review your trackings</h2>
    <p>If you want to check the list of Pokemon you are tracking at any time, simply send the following command: <code>!myTracking</code>      and the bot will reply with the full list of your tracking notifications.</p>

    <a name="stop"></a>
    <h2>Stop and (re)start the notifications</h2>
    <p>If, at any time, you will feel that you want to stop the notifications, you can always use the following command: <code>!stop</code>.
      This will prevent the bot from sending you any new information about spawns you are tracking, however, all your settings
      will still be stored and waiting for your return.</p>
    <p>If you want to unpause your notifications, just send: <code>!start</code> and you will start receiving notifications
      from that point again.</p>

    <a name="custom-notifications"></a>
    <h2>Custom notifications format</h2>
    <p>This topic is covered as a part of our <a href="/help-advanced">Advanced Users Help Page</a>.</p>

    <a name="unregistering"></a>
    <h2>Unregistering</h2>
    <p>While we are not planning on removing inactive accounts, if you want yours removed from the database, just send following
      command: <code>!unregister</code>. Be aware that all your custom settings and trackings will be removed and we will
      not be able to recover them.</p>

    <a name="bugs"></a>
    <h2>I found a bug, what to do now?</h2>
    <p>First of all - sorry for that. We are striving to provide you with the best experience possible, but unfortunately, as
      always with the software, errors do happen.</p>
    <p>If you believe you found a bug - a command didn't work for you or a notification was missing for example - come to
      <a href="https://discord.gg/AWdp2BM">Discord</a> and post about your problem on the <em>#dev</em> channel.</p>
